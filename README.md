# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction

This project uses machine learning models to predict the quality of red wine based on various physicochemical properties. The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009).

 Problem Statement
Predict whether a wine is of good quality (quality score >= 7) using classification models based on chemical attributes like acidity, sugar, and alcohol.
